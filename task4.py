# Create a variable called `text` to store the data: `Berlin is surrounded by the State 
# of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital.` . 
#     Your task is to check if  the word `capital`  is included in the text, if so, 
#     print the index of the location inside the `text` string.

# - Your result should look like this:

# ```
# capital: 92
# ```

text="Berlin is surrounded by the State of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital."
print(text.find("capital"))
