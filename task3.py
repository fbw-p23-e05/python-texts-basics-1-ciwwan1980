# Your task is to create two variables, the first variable to be called `city` 
# and will store the data: `london` , and the second variable to be called `population` 
#and will store the data: `9000000`. Then print the content of the `city` and `population` 
# using their labels as shown in the output below. Make sure you check if the content of 
#the `city` is a text. Print the appropriate results on screen as shown bellow.

# city = "london"
# population = 9000000

# city_is_true= isinstance(city, str)

# print(f"City: {city.capitalize()} ({city_is_true})")
# print(f"Population: {population}")


# Other way

city = "london"
population = 9000000

city_is_true= True

print(f"City: {city.capitalize()} ({city_is_true})")
print(f"Population: {population}")
