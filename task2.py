# Your task is to create two variables, the first variable to be called `city` and will store the data: `berlin` , and the second variable to be called `population` and will store the data: `3645000`. Then print the content of the `city` and `population` using a colon (`:`)  in between.  Make sure you capitalize the content of the `city` variable.

# - Your result should look like this:

# ```
# Berlin: 3645000
# ```


city="berlin"
population="3645000"

print(city.capitalize()+": "+ population)
